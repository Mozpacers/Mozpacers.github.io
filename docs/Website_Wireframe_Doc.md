## The DevSprint V1.0 Website wireframe documentation

We propose to design a single page website, which essentially means that all menu options would lead to specific parts of the same page. The various elements of the single page website are as follows :-

1. An action bar, with tabzilla format and links to the following parts of the page :- 
..* Home
..* About Us
..* Contact Us ( more links will be added as the development process moves ahead )

2. The first thing is a collage of all the previous events and meetups, which will be a bit faded. On top of it we will have the Mozilla Delhi Logo and some text. 

3. We require having a link to the official website, just like Mozilla Tunisia provides. 

4.  We require two divs to list the past and upcoming events. Each event in these divisions which have action buttons. Clicking on anyone of the link will take the user to a separate events page which can have more details.

5. Links to the important programmes by Mozilla, like FoxYeah, Web Maker, Mozilla Reps etc. arranged in a tile view like the official Mozilla website. A proposal for this could be to use a custom slider like Tunisia’s main slider.

6. Very important div- Our Motivation. Small and concise.

7. A slider to show the members of our group, with wordart like positions and names. Each Mozillian’s profile can be accessed by clicking on his image.

8. Contact/Registration form with full width.

9. A footer with links to facebook, twitter,wikipages etc.

10. We have two wide options to choose the color combinations from, one is we can create a website like Tunisia, or else we can get inspired from the current official Mozilla website.One thing that remains consistent is the Font sizes and shapes. Logos can’t be edited always and a thorough check before applying anything is a must. 
 
The wireframes have already been shared with everyone on slack.
